All sessions will be 9-11 AM on Tuesday<!--in the [Data Studio](https://new.library.arizona.edu/visit/spaces/data-studio) of the Main Library-->. To get the most out of these workshops, participants should bring a laptop with [R and RStudio installed](https://jcoliver.github.io/learn-r/000-setup-instructions.html).
