An introduction to using the R statistics package and the RStudio interface.

####Learning objectives
1. Read data from files and output results
2. Extract relevant portions of datasets
3. Run standard statistical tests in R, including Student's t, linear regression
and analysis of variance

###Setup
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dir.create(path = "data")
dir.create(path = "output")
```

###Student's _t_
```{r}
# Use the iris data
# Subset setosa and versicolor data
# Compare Petal.Length of these two species
```

###Linear regression
```{r}
# Download gapminder data
# Subset for a single year
# Quick plot of data
# Transformation of gdpPercap
# Test lifeExp vs. log.gdpPercap
```

###Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
```{r}
# Again on gapminder subset for single year
# Ask use Continent as predictor of gdp? lifeExp?
```
