An introduction to using the R statistics package and the RStudio interface for multivariate statistics.

#### Learning objectives
1. Install and use third-party packages for R
2. Use layering to add elements to a plot
3. Format plots with faceting

## Setup
### Workspace organization
First we need to setup our development environment. We need to create two folders: 'data' will store the data we will be analyzing, and 'output' will store the results of our analyses.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
dir.create(path = "data")
dir.create(path = "output")
```

From this point on, we want to keep track of what we have done, so we will restrict our use of the console and instead use script files. Start a new script with some brief header information at the very top. We want, at the very least, to include:
1. A short description of what the script does (no more than one line of text)
2. Your name
3. A means of contacting you (e.g. your e-mail address)
4. The date, preferably in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD
```{r}
# Plot gapminder data
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2017-02-23
```

### Installing additional packages
There are two steps to using additional packages in R:
1. Install the package through `install.packages()`
2. Load the package into active memory with `library()`

For this exercise, we will install the `ggplot2` package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")
```

It is important to note that for each computer you work on, the `install.packages` command need only be issued once, while the call to `library` will need to be issued for each session of R. Because of this, it is standard convention in scripts to comment out the `install.packages` command once it has been run on the machine, so our script now looks like:

```{r}
# Plot gapminder data
# Jeff Oliver
# jcoliver@email.arizona.edu
# 2017-02-23

#install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")
```

## Plot!

***

### Scatterplot
1. lifeExp vs. gdp
2. lifeExp vs. log(gdp)
3. lifeExp vs. log(gdp) color by continent
4. lifeExp vs. log(gdp) color by continent with custom colors
5. ggsave

***

### Violin plot
1. Y: gdp, X: continent
2. Y: log(gdp), X: continent
3. Y: log(gdp), X: continent, color with scale_fill_gradient for log(gdp)
4. Add theme_bw()
ggsave
