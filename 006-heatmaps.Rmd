A worked example of making heatmaps in R with the `ggplot` package, as well as some data wrangling to easily format the data needed for the plot.

#### Learning objectives
1. Manipulate data into a 'tidy' format
2. Visualize data in a heatmap
3. Become familiar with `ggplot` syntax for customizing plots

## Heatmaps & data wrangling
Heatmaps are a great way of displaying three-dimensional data in only two dimensions. But how can we easily translate tabular data into a format for heatmap plotting? By taking advantage of "data munging" and graphics packages, heatmaps are relatively easy to produce in R.
