## [DESCRIPTION OR MOTIVATION]
What if there was a way to include text _and_ all the code we used for our analyses in a single document? What about a report that includes not only data visualization, but the actual code used to produce those visualizations? With literate programming, we write text and code in a single document - this way, we can update reports and manuscripts with new data or corrections with minimal effort.
